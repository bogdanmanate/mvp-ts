# Conway's Game of Life
Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

# Initializing the game
We will start the game by randomly generating 25% alive cells.
